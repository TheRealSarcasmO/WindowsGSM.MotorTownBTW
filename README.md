### NOTE
- max_players this can't be more than 100 ish I think <=was hardcoded from what I picked up in the community. Subject to change.
- When you Install/Start the server you need to copy DedicatedServerConfig_Sample.json.. see instructions below

## Set up
1. Run the game, not the server, and exit
2. It will Generate DedicatedServerConfig_Sample.json in the server folder
3. Select your newly installed server and click Browse then click Server Files
4. Click on DedicatedServerConfig.json and open it to edit it.
5. Edit server name, player counts, etc.
6. Add your Admins if you want using UniqueNetID = SteamID64 and then their "Nickname" = MotorTown username
7. Then "save as"  DedicatedServerConfig.json
8. Start the Server

## How to copy client save files to the dedicated server
Copy client save folder to server save folder
Client save folder: %appdata%..\Local\MotorTown\Saved\SaveGames
Server save folder: <Dedicated Server Local Files Folder>\Saved\SaveGames
(Note that only the first character's world is compatible with the dedicated server)

### Note
Dedicated Server is 'black console screen and no input is available'
If you are using a router, you need to Port Forward Port 7777 and 27015 (UDP/TCP)

### Steam Cloud?
No (At least for now)

### Should I copy SaveGames from/to User Folder?
It's optional.
The client uses 'User' Folder and Dedicated server uses its installed Folder
You can copy from/to if you want.
But only the first character's world is used by the Dedicated server
